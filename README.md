**Invite System written in PHP with a working Register / Login system**

- Basically with MySQL u can count invites to a person.
- Invites basically when the user invites someone to your website: e.g: yourwebsite.com?invite=1.
- Then it adds +1 invite to his name.
- Your invite code depends on your ID in the database.

The code is clean, probably everywhere.
I made it in 2 hours, so if the code somewhere does not makes sense, or not clean, then it's because of that.

Features:

1. Every 5 minute can the user invite somebody. <- If the user invites somebody before the cooldown expires, then it just redirects the user to register.php.
2. In the index.php u can:

    - Copy ur invite code.
    - Get ur current mail.
    - Get ur username (Hello, {user}).
    - Registered users (counted).
    - Logout.
  
4. Error handling while login / making an account.
5. Without logging in u can't access index.php.
